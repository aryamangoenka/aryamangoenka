# 👋 Hey there, I'm Aryaman Goenka!

I'm a Computer Science student at UMass Amherst (Class of 2028) passionate about building intelligent systems that make a real-world impact. From drag-and-drop neural networks to MLOps automation and ethical AI moderation tools — I love turning ideas into scalable products using Python, JavaScript, and a touch of curiosity.

Currently learning ML through the MIT Break Through Tech AI Program and leading AI-driven projects through MassAI.
